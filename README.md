To use this macro first you need: Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and OCR (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed on your system

#1. Run "get_wisp_box.py" with your ritual cast open, this allows the machine to know where to look when autocasting
#2. Run "main.pyw", this will open a background process. Press f5 to toggle, starts disabled
#3. As long as main.pyw is running and you have the macro on, your ritual casts will be automatically completed!

NOTE: When running get_wisp_box.py make sure to:
#have the background behind the ritual cast be a solid surface/one colour
#close your inventory before tabbing into roblox
this ensures the macro is accurate and does not give a false positive (even if it does, just run it again with a different threshold)
