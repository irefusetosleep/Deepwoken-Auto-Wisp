To use this macro first you need: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/download/5.5.0/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.5.0.20241111.exe) installed on your system

#1. Run "get_wisp_box.py" with your ritual cast open, this allows the machine to know where to look when autocasting
#2. Run "main.pyw", this will open a background process. 
#3. As long as main.py is running and you have the macro on, your ritual casts will be automatically completed!

NOTE: When running get_wisp_box.py make sure to:
#have the background behind the ritual cast be a solid surface/one colour, this makes the reading more consistent (just look at the floor)
#close your inventory before tabbing into roblox, this ensures the macro is accurate and does not give a false positive (even if it does, just run it again with a different threshold)
